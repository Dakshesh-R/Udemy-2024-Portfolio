<h1>The Best movie according to Dakshesh</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies as of recent</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p>Really good looking and I like some characters a lot. It's Christopher Nolan.</p>
<h3>Stree 2</h3>
<p>The characters, the dialogue and the delivery really do it for me.</p>
<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p>One of the most well paced movies I've seen in the recent times. + I love the teeny tiny details.</p>
